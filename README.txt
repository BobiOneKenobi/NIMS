NIMS
=====
This Matlab toolbox has been developed to plot and to analyze (nano)indentation data (with conical indenters).
Please, have a look to the full documentation here: http://nims.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

To get started with NIMS, clone the repository, then run Matlab, and cd into the folder containing this README file.

You can start the launcher by typing "GUI_Extraction_EP_properties_for_multilayer_sample" at the Matlab command prompt.

Features
--------
This Matlab toolbox has been developed to : 
- Plot and Analyze nanoindentation dataset; 
- Coefficient of the power law fit of the load-displacement curve; 
- Energy of the loading (area below the load-displacement curve); 
- Young's modulus and Hardness of bulk materials; 
- Young's modulus of thin films on a substrate (for a bilayer or a multilayer sample (3 layers on a substrate)); 
- Generate Python script for FEM simulation of indentation test on multilayer sample with Abaqus.
