Examples of nanoindentation data
================================
..  include:: <isonum.txt>
..  |matlab| replace:: Matlab\ :sup:`TM` \

Format of data
##############

* Both .txt or .xls files are accepted.
* Only the loading part of your (nano)indentation results !
* 3 columns (Displacement/Load/Stiffness) or 6 columns (Disp./SD of Disp./Load/SD of Load/Stiff./SD of Stiff.) (SD for Standard Deviation)
* Units : Displacement (nm) / Load (mN) / Stiffness (N/m)
* For .xls files : It is possible to import a 'Sample' sheet obtained from MTS software - Analyst (with a 'Hold Segment Type')
